# Undertale-Tool-WASD-for-Arrowkeys
Currently Version 1.0.0

This is a tool I made for Undertale, it maps WASD to arrow keys so you too can enjoy Undertale fan games and, the game in general if you do not have working arrow keys.

Let it be known, i'm not like a professional programmer or anything. So, I recommend not using this tool, because it may not function as intended. (I didnt have any problems )



Requirements:
  - JNativeHook: Key Listener. Look at the github for more info (https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook)
